big fish 3 todo

bug: plays error sound on unlock purchase even if success

unlock 100,1000 btns later, add 10k btns

add warning icon for "each costs more than previous"


increasing cost can be decreased with increasingly expensive upgrades

notify that you would lose if buying fish at exactly 0 coins
change fullscreen icon

balance increasing costs, needs to increase MUCH slower
check unlocks
make game playable longer

rework code with eslint and js doc
use tailwind? replace jquery with umbrella?
svelte? typescript?
js doc
installable pwa
bug: stats should update live?
question: does settings store bank input vals?
todo: check prev todo for direction for where to go next with game
bug? files being requested twice in network tab dev tools?

bug: bank description text doesnt account for increasing cost

add 10k btns unlocked later
unlock banks sooner
after 100 hatcheries or 10k fish
double aquarium space? half default building costs again?
option to play game at 10x tick speed (console hack?)

make it a pwa
check time login since last time? nah
divide increasing cost buildings by 8, rebalance unlocks

add more upgrades, achievements for having upgrades?

banks dynamically buying upgrades unlock?

end game achievements are all clumped (achievement for that, olympic, monopoly, thanks for all, big banking, fishy business, watergate), should separate them out more



SHARK IDEAS

Big fish shark ideas

Start with 1m land
Food farms use 1 land, sm hatchery uses 1, md 3 lg 5. Aquariums use 10, banks use 50, aquarium factories use 100, hatchery factories and farm factories will use 50

Unlock land stuff at 50% land usage

Sharks eat 1k fish per s, and cost 1m coins (increasing)

Tanks cost 1b coins (increasing)

Each shark with a tank earns 1k land per s

Shark hatcheries cost 1t coins, tank factories cost 1q coins (both increasing cost)

Achievement "shark tank" for your first one, achievement "tank top" for 1k sharks and tanks

Tanks take up 5 land
