bug: plays error sound on unlock purchase even if success

implications for "beating game" after big fish achievement, open modal and say congrats and show playtime

maybe: notify that you would lose if buying fish at exactly 0 coins

rework code with eslint and js doc
use tailwind? replace jquery with umbrella?
svelte? typescript?
js doc
installable pwa
bug: stats should update live?
question: does settings store bank input vals?
todo: check prev todo for direction for where to go next with game
bug? files being requested twice in network tab dev tools?

bug: bank description text doesnt account for increasing cost

maybe: achievement for unlocking all unlocks?

option to play game at 10x tick speed (console hack?)

check time login since last time? nah

future: add more upgrades, achievements for having upgrades?

late development: banks dynamically buying upgrades unlock?



SHARK IDEAS

Big fish shark ideas

Start with 1m land
Food farms use 1 land, sm hatchery uses 1, md 3 lg 5. Aquariums use 10, banks use 50, aquarium factories use 100, hatchery factories and farm factories will use 50

Unlock land stuff at 50% land usage

Sharks eat 1k fish per s, and cost 1m coins (increasing)

Tanks cost 1b coins (increasing)

Each shark with a tank earns 1k land per s

Shark hatcheries cost 1t coins, tank factories cost 1q coins (both increasing cost)

Achievement "shark tank" for your first one, achievement "tank top" for 1k sharks and tanks

Tanks take up 5 land
