alpha notes:

add more attention to top area with basic info

something that specifices that it's food for small fish

add volume slider

look into tab height vs line height

center align bottom buttons, and content in help modal

log scale progress bars for rates of a few basic things

store food in silos, money in something

performance settings

setting to clear or not clear bank inputs to max. default to clear.

bug: cannot sell full aquarium appears when aquarium isn't full

put in help: you can drag to change the order for banks

save data btn and on logout

"purchasing power" as word to describe banks

why am i not producing more fish? aquarium full or have more of the fish that eats it

final achievement: pause buffer-able

final achievement 1m of each fish for 10 ticks "balancing act"

typo: "your multiplier increase" needs "s" at end in multiplier modal

use num abreviations in hover title for bar

possible lag: creating then destroying small fish immedatly... same for medium (unnecessary)

baren spelled barren

typo: eat food to eat fish per sec

unlocked volumes should say volume, same with fullscreen. pluralize Boolean param in unlocks

make your key info more obvious, account stuff more obvious, click 1 food btn more obvious

fix lag, add settings

save inputs from banks in savedata

top display should say "coins" not coin
